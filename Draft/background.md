##### Synapse detection
> To begin identifying synapses from GABA-negative axons, 2D
> segmentation of PSD-95 IF was performed by applying a threshold, set
> to include all IF puncta above the background autofluorescence (see
> Fig. 9a).  For quantitative consistency, this threshold was defined by
> lowering the threshold until the resulting segmentation produced a
> median PSD-95 punctum size of > 0.09 µm². We merged 2D PSD-95 puncta
> from adjacent sections into a single 3D PSD-95 punctum when their IF
> weighted centroids were < 400 nm apart (see Fig. 9c).  The threshold
> was set at 400 nm, because analysis of the conjugate AT data show that
> ~90% of all such merges resulted in linking PSD-95 puncta that overlap
> with the same synapse, without merging distinct synapses (see Fig.
> 10a).
