# Synaptome Statistics: Notes 

The following is a short report on the exploration of the Kristina15
(K15).  Putative synapse locations have been
detected in kristina15 with Forrest's synapse detection algorithm.
For each feature channel
(Synapsin, VGlut, psd95, etc.) an 11x11x11 cube is extracted around
each putative synapse location and the pixel intensities are summed, creating
a feature vector of length (number of channels, say $d$). This gives us an $n
\times d$ matrix, where the $n$ rows correspond to putative synapses and
the $d$ columns correspond to the summed immunoflorescence in each
channel.

## Synaptogram Code

We currently have code that generates synaptograms
[here](https://github.com/neurodata/synaptome-stats/blob/17f0c715a365b910794852f5e3741e44aae102c8/Code2/R/k15Synaptograms.R). 
We are working to make sure that our generated synaptograms correspond
to the correct locations in the image space and that the proper scaling
transformations are being applied. We have decided that z-scoreing
appears to be best and are employing that to all of our analyses.

#### Draft example synaptogram from the K15 dataset.
