# Synaptome Statistics: Notes 

The following is a short report on the exploration of the Kristina15
(K15).  Putative synapse locations have been
detected in kristina15 with Forrest's synapse detection algorithm.
For each feature channel
(Synapsin, VGlut, psd95, etc.) an 11x11x11 cube is extracted around
each putative synapse location and the pixel intensities are summed, creating
a feature vector of length (number of channels, say $d$). This gives us an $n
\times d$ matrix, where the $n$ rows correspond to putative synapses and
the $d$ columns correspond to the summed immunoflorescence in each
channel.


We have run [MEDA](http://github.com/neurodata/meda/) on a sample of
5000 putative synapse locations in the Kristina15 dataset. The
hierarchical clustering results are plotted below.  For this particular
run the data was 
[Z-scored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score#Calculation_from_raw_score)

## Clustering 

We have implemented our own Hierarchical Mclust function by augmenting
Mclust.  In the course of exploring we used the full suite of models
available in 
[mclustModelNames p. 88](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/mclust.pdf)

After looking through the BIC plots of each of the 11 models for each
node of the tree it seemed best to use the unconstrained model "VVV" =
ellipsoidal, varying volume, shape, and orientation. 

The first pass of BIC on K15 with 10,000 sample points, appear below and both show that
"VVV" is the best model when comparing for K = {1,2}.

Towards the bottom of the tree, where clusters are getting smaller "VVV"
tends to suggest against splitting the data. Looking through the
BIC plots for multiple explorations we also see that "VVV" is not very
bad when compared to the other models.  
These observations seem to justify our choice "VVV" for further use.

## Scaling 

We have looked at various transformations of the data: Raw, $log_{10}$, and
scaling between 0 and 1000 and Z-scoring. Full lab notebooks can be found 
[here](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/) 

Below we have the clustering results from hierarchical GMM.  Each level is shown 
with the means of the features of each node given in color (purple -
low, orange - high).
Note that the 0-1000 results are the last in the triple of plots.

Below are our stacked level mean plots which show for each level in the
cluster tree (separated by black horizonal lines) the means accross each 
of the features (low - purple, high - orange).

- [K15 Log_10](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/examples/Kristina15/figs/k15Log_seed1234_size10000.png)
- [K15 0-1000](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/examples/Kristina15/figs/k1501e3_seed1234_size10000.png)

![K15 Raw](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/examples/Kristina15/figs/k15Raw_seed1234_size10000.png)
![K15 Log_10](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/examples/Kristina15/figs/k15Log_seed1234_size10000.png)
![K15 0-1000](http://docs.neurodata.io/meda/examples/Kristina15/figs/k1501e3_seed1234_size10000.png)

Out of these three different methods of transforming the data we tend to
prefer the [0-1000] scaling. Empirically it seems to capture —
interestingly —
the differences in the feature categories (Excitatory - green, Inhibatory - red, 
Other - blue). The $log_{10}$ transform fails to reveal any clusters
that have significantly higher than average excitatory expression.

## Synaptogram Code

We currently have code that generates synaptograms
[here](https://github.com/neurodata/synaptome-stats/blob/17f0c715a365b910794852f5e3741e44aae102c8/Code2/R/k15Synaptograms.R). 
We are working to make sure that our generated synaptograms correspond
to the correct locations in the image space and that the proper scaling
transformations are being applied. We have decided that z-scoreing
appears to be best and are employing that to all of our analyses.
