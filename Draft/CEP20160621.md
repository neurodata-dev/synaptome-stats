## Notes that need help
- [ ] Use FlashGraph in a docker (slacked Disa).
- [ ] run GMM & BIC for \hat{k} on existing detections [and check if
  cov's are different]
- [ ] Let the null be p1 = p2 = ... = pd (run ANOVA, ie, check whether
  cov's are different)
- [ ] Run GMM on the whole thing (~billion points), we want to estimate
  the 24*6 dimensional distribution (full covariance).  - Collect points
thresholding on each channel individually so that there isn't a channel
bias. 
- Ripley's K (test?)
- Silverman table (grazing goats?)

@jovo here's what I have.  Please fill in anything I missed or didn't
jot down fully. ??
